In creating my resume, I realized I had skills in web development with nothing to show, so I decided it would be appropriate to design a personal web portfolio--one that could showcase my ability to create websites.

I created the web site using Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, and [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com). It contained [CRUDing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) for projects and blog posts gated by an administrative login.

Later, I realized the setup was a little overkill for a simple portfolio, so I recreated the website using the static site generator provided with Node.js, which you are viewing right now!
