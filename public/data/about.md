Hello, I'm Tareq Alyousef.

I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science and a minor in mathematics with a data science concentration at the University of Memphis.

I've been creating video games ever since I discovered the Blender Game Engine at 12 years old. Over these years, I've mastered multiple game development stacks.

After the 2020 stock market crash my interests grew into quantitative research--today, I study financial markets through algorithmic trading.
